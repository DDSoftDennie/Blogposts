# JOIN OUR UNIQUE ACTIVITY !

Next week I am joining LeadDev London to co-host a Community Representation Group (CRG) for leaders on the autism spectrum. This will be a unique opportunity to share your experiences: What works and what doesn't work for you as an autistic individual (or person/ leader on the autism spectrum) with other leaders on the spectrum.

I am very honored to have this opportunity together with Jonathan Fielding & Lucia Velasco. Thanks to the LeadDev team for inviting me to come to London and co-host this CRG for leaders on the autism spectrum!

If you are a leader on the autism spectrum and you are in London next week, please join us! You can sign up for the event here: [LeadDev London](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london).
