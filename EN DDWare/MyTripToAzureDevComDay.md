# My Trip to Azure Dev Community Day Munich

## Introduction

On December 3rd I went to the Azure Dev Community Day in Munich. I even had the chance to give a talk about how Generative AI is helping me as a person on the autism spectrum. I was very excited to meet new people and learn new things. I was also looking forward to the talks! 

## The Talks

In the keynote from Microsoft (by Henk Boelman), we learned about AI on Azure. He showed us how to use Azure.
