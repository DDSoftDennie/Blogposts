# CloudBrew 2024

## Introduction

Today I visited and spoke at CloudBrew 2024. It was a great event with a lot of interesting sessions. I had the opportunity to speak about Azure Functions and how to use them in combination with Azure AI. I also saw some great sessions on Generative AI and how to use it in combination with Azure Cognitive Services. I learned a lot and I hope to be back next year!
