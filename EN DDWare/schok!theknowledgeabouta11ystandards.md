# SHOCK! The Knowledge About Accessibility Standards

This spring, I was at about ten conferences in Belgium, Europe, and the US. I must admit that I am still shocked by the lack of knowledge about accessibility and the generally published, validated, and recognized standards on accessibility.

## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility has different variants. Accessibility is a basic idea that has been applied since time immemorial in the construction industry in the physical world and also has a digital variant because the world we live in is no longer just physical:

    - Accessible = The ability to have access to.
    - Accessibility = The degree to which something is accessible.
    - The degree to which something is accessible = The number of people with or without disabilities who have access to something.

In the physical world, this is translated into, for example, a ramp for wheelchair users, an elevator for people who are not good on their feet, a braille board for people with visual impairments, tactile footpaths for people who work with touch (people who are visually impaired or blind), pedestrian lights with sound for people who are visually impaired or blind, etc.

Because we focus on digital, the rest of this article is about digital accessibility.

## What is Digital Accessibility?

Digital accessibility is the degree to which a digital product is accessible to people with disabilities. This can be about a website, an app, a software package, an online service, etc…

## What is a Disability?

A disability is a condition that a person has. This can be a congenital condition, a condition that has arisen from an accident, a condition that has arisen from a disease, etc.

## Meet WCAG, the Standard for Digital Accessibility

The initiative and consortium around the internet that we know today (WWW: “World Wide Web”) has had a standard for digital accessibility for many years. This standard is called WCAG (“Web Content Accessibility Guidelines”). This standard is an international standard that is used by most countries in the world. This standard is also the basis for European legislation on digital accessibility. This legislation is the European Accessibility Act. This legislation was approved in 2019 and will be in force in 2025. This legislation is a minimum standard. This means that countries in the European Union can tighten this legislation but cannot relax it.

The standard has 4 categories and 3 levels of accessibility. The 4 categories are:

- Perceptibility
- Operability
- Understandability
- Robustness

The 3 levels are:
    - A
    - AA
    - AAA

These levels are like steps. Level A is the bottom step of the stairs, level AA is the middle step of the stairs and level AAA is the top step of the stairs. Level A is the minimum standard you must meet to comply with the legislation. Level AA is the standard that most countries in the European Union use. Level AAA is the highest standard and is not used by most countries in the European Union. Level AAA is a standard you can use if you want to make a website, app, software package, online service, etc. accessible to everyone.

## The Standard Briefly Explained

Perceivable:
    - The content of a website, app, software package, online service, etc. must be perceptible to everyone. This means that this content must be perceptible to people with visual impairments, people with hearing impairments, people with cognitive impairments, etc. This can be done, for example, by using colors, contrasts, fonts, font sizes, etc.

Operable:
    - The content of a website, app, software package, online service, etc. must be operable for everyone. This means that this content must be operable for people with motor impairments, people with cognitive impairments, etc. This can be done, for example, by using keyboard navigation, mouse navigation, voice navigation, etc.

Understandable:
     - The content of a website, app, software package, online service, etc. must be understandable for everyone. This means that this content must be understandable for people with cognitive impairments, people with visual impairments, etc. This can be done, for example, by using clear language, clear icons, etc.

Robust:
    - The content of a website, app, software package, online service, etc. must be robust for everyone. This means that this content must be robust for people with cognitive impairments, people with visual impairments, etc. This can be done, for example, by using good code, good structure, etc.

## Where Can I Find the Standard?

The standard can be found on the website of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). This is the organization that manages the standard. The standard can be found at the following link: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/ The official Dutch translation of the standard can be found at the following link: https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG21-nl/

## How Can I Use the Standard?

In the coming period we will post several posts here about the specific categories of standards. How to understand them and how to apply them.

Of course you can also take the shortcut and let us give a workshop. We give workshops about the standard and how to apply it. More information about our workshops can be found at the following link: https://ware.ddsoft.be/en/training/

In addition we can also do consulting for your web project: https://ware.ddsoft.be/en/consulting-accessibility/

## Conclusion

There is a standard for digital accessibility that will also be enforced by law. But let accessibility not be an obligation. Let accessibility be a choice. A choice to let everyone participate in the digital world. A choice to let everyone participate in the digital economy. A choice to let everyone participate in the digital society. A choice to let everyone participate in the digital world of tomorrow.
