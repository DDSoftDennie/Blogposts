# AI at Research 2 Reality Brussels

## Introduction

On February 5th and 6th, I attended Research 2 Reality Brussels. This event was organized by the European Commission. The event was held in the beautiful city of Brussels, Belgium. The event was a great opportunity to learn about European research and policy making in the field of AI and (Quantum) Computing. In this blogpost, I will share some of the key takeaways from the event.

The first day (February 5th) was a typical conference day with keynotes, talks and panel discussions from various leaders from companies and authorities from the European Commission. The second day (February 6th), we got the opportunity to visit a company that focusses on those innovations. I visited FARI, the AI for Common Good Institute in Brussels. We also got some keynotes at the Google Digital Atelier in Brussels and got a walkthrough at the Startup hub in Brussels.

## Luc van Den Hove 's Vision on Mindset

Luc Van Den Hove, CEO and President of IMEC, the world-leading research and innovation hub in nanoelectronics, chips and digital technologies, gave a keynote on the importance of mindset in the digital age. The keyword he used was 'We Believe'. For me, also known as Mr. #DreamingIsBelieving it was enlightening to see how Luc is promoting a positive mindset to handle current challenges with technology.

His vision on mindset is that we need to move from a grants mindset to an entrepreneurial mindset. Instead of chasing for grants from the government, we should focus on creating value and impact as an entrepreneur.

Let's recap: everything we do on our computers, cloud and smartphones to make impact is based on chips. Research in chips makes it possible to innovate even more in AI and (quantum) computing.

It was also interesting to see that here in Belgium there is also a focus on Quantum Computing. After this session, I am even more proud on my country Belgium.

## European Commission: A sovereign Europe

Saila Rinne, Acting Head of Unit at the European Commission gave a session and led a panel discussion on EU Funding programs in support of data-driven innovation in healthcare. In her session and in the panel one thing was loud and clear: We need to move 'From Mediocracy to Excellence'. The narrative of people and entrepreneurs in the EU is too humble. We need to change the narrative and see the benefits of sovereignty and sovereign computing in Europe.

Later on in this blogpost, I will share some concepts I learned at Research 2 Reality Brussels that are based on the narrative of sovereignty and and how this can be a competitive advantage for European startups and companies.
