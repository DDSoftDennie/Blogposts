# My experiences at NDC London 2025

## Keynote: AI without BS, for humans 
- Speaker: Scott Hanselman

In this very inspring keynote Scott learned us how to use AI to make the world a better place.
Besides of this, he also noted that AI is not a silver bullet and that we should be aware of the risks.

He is more fan of RAG than only LLM's spitting out BS.
